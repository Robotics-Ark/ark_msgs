Please add a description of the addition or bugfix.

If you are adding a new message type, you must
- [ ] provide the `.proto` file in `proto/ark_msgs`, one message type per file
- [ ] provide helper method where necessary, eg. see Geometry message types
- [ ] provide documentation in the `README.md`
  - consider if your new message belongs to one of the already existing groups
  - if not, then create a new group and provide an appropriate name

If you are providing a bugfix, please ensure you have already [opened a new issue](https://github.com/Robotics-Ark/ark_msgs/issues/new).
